It seems that the security community has mixed feelings about certifications. On one side, they are seen as a way to break into (or advance in) the field and as a way to highlight individual skills. On the other, some argue that certifications are overly commercialized or that they can signal a focus on course-taking and cert-chasing rather than building real-world experience.

There was a tweet (that I cannot find) that said something to the tune of:

> "Say what you will about the usefulness of certifications, but if your employer offers you a free knowledge level-up, and you don't take it, then that says more about you."

It depends upon the certification, but I agree. In my view, certifications are a tool to use in a broader journey of growth. They demonstrate commitment, discipline, and the ability to master structured learning â€” but they remain only one piece of the puzzle. The real value comes from applying that knowledge to solve problems and deliver meaningful impact.

All that being said, here are the certifications I've chosen to acquire.
