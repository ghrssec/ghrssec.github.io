Below I have listed the top 15 books that have shaped the way I think, build discipline, lead, and live with purpose. Each one taught me something crucial, and I return to them often. Although there are many other outstanding books on the subject of personal development, these are my choices (in no particular order). 

> I originally attempted to make a list of 10, but was completely unable to stop there.

Fear, procrastination, and conformity are tools of the Devil. Purpose and definiteness are your weapons.

#### 10. <u><strong>Meditations</strong></u> by Marcus Aurelius 
Control what you can, accept what you can’t. Be disciplined, humble, and always ready to serve.

No one else is responsible—own everything in your world. Leadership starts and ends with you.

You’re not separate from the world—you are it. A mind-bending take on identity, responsibility, and reality.

#### 15. <u><strong>Can’t Hurt Me</strong></u> by David Goggins
